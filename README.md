# Final Project

This is the final project for my CIS-207 Fundamentals of Web Programming course at Kirkwood Community College.

## Introduction

I actual did not know anything about programming. Learning how to program and the tools to do it has been fun. Git bash was intresting to learn because I have never done anything like it. Visual studio code is very interesting to use and easy. It has so many ways to code and you can use most all of the progamming languages in it. Learning the different commands and codes that I need to learn is hard, but I think I can do it. I think programming will be fun and I'm looking forward to learning more.
