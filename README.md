# Final Project

This is the final project for my CIS-207 Fundamentals of Web Programming course at Kirkwood Community College.

## Introduction

I actual did not know anything about programming. Learning how to program and the tools to do it has been fun. Git bash was intresting to learn because I have never done anything like it. Visual studio code is very interesting to use and easy. It has so many ways to code and you can use most all of the progamming languages in it. Learning the different commands and codes that I need to learn is hard, but I think I can do it. I think programming will be fun and I'm looking forward to learning more. 

## Chapter 1 

We learned how to make a CSS file so we can change the look of our web page with colors and padding and margins. Using the colors was interesting because you have to decide on the text color and the background color. You can also make the page look nice with the padding and margins by putting a boarder around the text and using margin to get the right distance from the edge of the web page and the outside of the box. And then using padding you can make the text look better on the inside of the box so it doesn't look all bunched together. You can also use a line break with the break tag to space out the paragraphs or to break up sentences.  

## Chapter 2 

I learned that you can test html with the help of the live server plug in to help show you how the page looks and if you could run it on the web browser. Learning how to make classes so that you can make a group seperate that makes it easy to use CSS to style that specific thing only. Also the id tag will do the sames thing. We also  learned about the boolian attributes Like making a checkbox. Using the div tag to to separate different parts of the code. 

## Chapter 3 

I learned how to change font styles and how to customize the letters to make them look cool. Like using a specific thing like neon to make a word or name to stick out. We learned how to use pre tags to make a block of text look like code. We used the block quote tag to indent a line. We learned how to put in an entity code like the copy right symbol and the degree symbol. We learned about block and inline elements like the "P" tag is a block element and the "span" tag is an inline element. We Also learned how to in one of our image folders to get an image and how to go back to a different folder to get and image also. 

## Chapter 4 

I learned the different specific measurements that can be used like px, pt, em, rem, and % but the most common are px and em and rem. I learned how to make the color of boxes see through so you can put an img behind it to make a web page look nice. We also learned about the specific selectors are used to make a certain part of the css that has a conflict to be overwritten by the most specific selector, but all will be overwritten by the !important selector. We also learned a little more of the fonts and how to use google fonts to get the right font we want for our page. 

## Chapter 5 

We learned a little more about the padding and margin. How to use height and width right and not to use the height tag much so that the background colors and images don't become smaller than the box. We learned how to use the min and max width and height. We learned how to style borders to be dotted line or inserted to make them look all fancy. We learned how to use radius to make the corners of a border to style it and we used border shadow to make it look like the border is off the page with a shadow. we learned how to use background images and make them not repeat and we learned how to use gradiants.

## Chapter 6 

we Learned how to make side bars and how to make them into a navigation bar. we learned how to use the columns to divide our page into 2 or 3 sections. We learned how to use the float property to set side bars or to put an image ot text on one side of the page. We learned how to position things of the screen. like to make something stay as you scroll you use the fixed atribute. We learned how to make things relative to the page with the relative tag. 

## Chapter 7 

We learned how to code nested list some more. We learned how to code links like how if the link text is to long you can put a title on it to make it shorter. You use the (a) tags to add a title to a link. We learned how to make navigation links to other site or to another html page that you created for your site. You can take the nav link in an unordered list to make a vertical nav bar. Also you can use an inline code in the css to make a horizontal nav bar. We learned how to make a socal media nav bar to send someone to an email or to a website or to a socal media account with the push of a button.

## Chapter 8

We learned how to make a responsive web page so that it can be viewed on most all devices, like a mobile phone and tablets. We learned that to test a website on devices it is best to deploy it to a server and then test it on all sorts of devices. Also you can use the developer tools on most browers today so you can test it on the mobile with the desktop. We learned how to use media tags in the css to help with the responsive web design so that you can have it be a different size for a mobile device. We learned how to make a fluid web page so that its pleasing to the eyes of anyone that visits the site.
