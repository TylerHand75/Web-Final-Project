# Final Project

This is the final project for my CIS-207 Fundamentals of Web Programming course at Kirkwood Community College.

## Introduction

I actual did not know anything about programming. Learning how to program and the tools to do it has been fun. Git bash was intresting to learn because I have never done anything like it. Visual studio code is very interesting to use and easy. It has so many ways to code and you can use most all of the progamming languages in it. Learning the different commands and codes that I need to learn is hard, but I think I can do it. I think programming will be fun and I'm looking forward to learning more. 

## Chapter 1 

We learned how to make a CSS file so we can change the look of our web page with colors and padding and margins. Using the colors was interesting because you have to decide on the text color and the background color. You can also make the page look nice with the padding and margins by putting a boarder around the text and using margin to get the right distance from the edge of the web page and the outside of the box. And then using padding you can make the text look better on the inside of the box so it doesn't look all bunched together. You can also use a line break with the break tag to space out the paragraphs or to break up sentences.
