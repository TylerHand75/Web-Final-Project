                    <h2>How to make your setup better</h2> 
                    <p> 
                        Having a desk crowded by unnecessary bottles, cables, PC equipment, and other items makes a gaming setup look completely unappealing. So you have to keep your setup clean by hiding the cables you have with some Zip Ties, cable sleeves, and cable channels, anyone can hide their cables without much hesitation. You can mount your monitors instead of having them sit on the desk to one give you more space and two to have them at a better eye level so you don't hurt your neck. Proper lighting makes a massive difference in comparison to almost no light. Installing some RGB strips behind your deks creates an entirely new atmosphere, which is the reason why many people take some time to install them. Posters are an excellent option to add some personality to a gaming setup. Stick with a cooler color for the lights like a blue and purple and stick with 1 to 3 colors so you are not overwhelmed by the colors. Use a nice wallpaper that fits your theme. You can also show case your computer by putting it on your desk or on a shelf next to your desk. These are just a few ways to make your computer setup look better.

                    <h2>Thoughts on Computers</h2>
                    <p>
                        Custom Computers are nice to have so you can show your style or your peosonality. They have many upsides and a few downsides, but they make it possible to play games and do work very well. At the end of the day, the choice is entirely up to you. If you want to have a nice setup you can do it or if you want to have just a laptop or to go all out and have all the monitors for your setup. Do what you want to make the setup yours. Use the things you think you want and have fun doing it.
