            <h2>CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party</h2>
            <p>There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were
                having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it
                as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. <span class= "alice">"Very uncomfortable for the
                    Dormouse,"</span> thought Alice; <span class= "alice">"only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind."</span></p>

            <p>The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it:<span class= "alice">"No room! No
                    room!"</span> they cried out when they saw Alice coming. <span class= "alice">"There's plenty of room!"</span> said
                Alice indignantly,
                and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.</p>
